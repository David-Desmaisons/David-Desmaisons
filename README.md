### Hi guys, welcome, my name is David Desmaisons!

French born, living in Brazil, I have been programming since the age of 10 (*saudades*  Amstrad CPC 6128).

Always curious, if I am looking for some piece of software that I can not find, I may end up implementing and publishing it as a github repository.

My main projects are:
* [Neutronium](https://github.com/NeutroniumCore/Neutronium) a C# framework to build .NET MVVM desktop applications using HTML, CSS and javascript.
* [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) a vue component that handles drag-and-drop.

My main stack is .Net and javascript but I have worked with C++ and Java, I love Python, I have a weird interest in prolog and I am always curious about learning new languages.

I may accept freelance opportunities if related to Vue.js or Neutronium.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improvements on [Neutronium](https://github.com/NeutroniumCore/Neutronium) and [Ornette](https://github.com/David-Desmaisons/Ornette) a music player at its early stage.
